    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Freddy Kreuger. As halloween approaches I remember the great
      many dreams I embedded during the 80s and 90s. Today, I'm very much reformed, and
      although I still live in your dreams, I've come to the conclusion that there is
      greater benefits of being friendly and positive. Today, I enjoy fishing in your lakes,
      skiing in your mountains, and taking hot baths in the springs of Mt. Fuji. I ensure
      you, if you let me in your dreams, only enjoyment will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, I wanted to take a moment to apologize to all my victims who I have harmed
      in their dreams. I had a rough childhood, and I believed for the longest time that no
      one could be friendly. You have to remember I was burned alive. Luckily, myself, Jason,
      and a couple of my other friends from the 80s have come together and formed a book club,
      and rehabilitation group which truly enjoys <i>devouring</i> a good intellectual body of work.
      I hope to meet lots of you this Halloween.
    </p>
    <p>Today, I live by my motto:</p>
    <blockquote><q>Sticks and stones may break my bones, but nothing will ever kill me.</q></blockquote>
